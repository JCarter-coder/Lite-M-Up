# Lite M Up

This is a game board where the object is to light all of the tiles up. Selecting a tile affects the lights of the four adjacent tiles. The game includes three board sizes (3x3, 4x4, and 5x5) which each include their own chiptune background music, and three color themes. Give it a try!

## Themes

The default theme incorporates a yellow (on) and dark green (off). To aid the player visually, the board's border and the score boxes beside the board reflect the "on" color. There is also a red/black theme and a jedi/sith theme (reminiscent of the color of light sabers)!

## Scoring

The current game score is reflected to the right of the game board. Each click of a tile will increase the score. The object is to solve the puzzle in the least amount of clicks. The best score defaults at 100 when the first game starts, and will update if the player completes a puzzle in less clicks than the recorded best score.
